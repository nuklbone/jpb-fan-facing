# How to Get Spotify Embed Codes for the Website

## Why You Need Embed Codes

Regular Spotify links (like `https://open.spotify.com/album/...`) will take users away from your site. **Embed codes keep users on your site** so they can listen without leaving.

## How to Get Embed URLs

### For Albums or Tracks:

1. **Open Spotify** (desktop app or web)
2. **Navigate to the album or track** you want to embed
3. **Click the "..." (three dots)** menu button
4. **Select "Share"**
5. **Click "Embed"**
6. **Copy the URL** from the embed code that appears
   - It will look like: `https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/...` or `https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/...`

### For Playlists:

Same process - go to your playlist, click "..." → "Share" → "Embed", and copy the embed URL.

### For Artist Pages:

Go to your artist page, click "..." → "Share" → "Embed", and copy the embed URL.

## What You Need to Provide

For each release, I need:

1. **Album/Track Name**
2. **Embed URL** (not the regular link)
   - ✅ Good: `https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j`
   - ❌ Bad: `https://open.spotify.com/album/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j`

## Current Status

Right now, I'm using your artist embed pages as placeholders:
- **Come to Play the Blues (2019)**: Using artist embed
- **Fire In My Hands (2025)**: Using artist embed

**Once you provide the album/track embed URLs, I'll replace these with the proper embeds so fans can listen to the specific albums/tracks directly on your site.**

## Example Format

Please provide embed URLs in this format:

```
Album: Come to Play the Blues (2019)
Embed URL: https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/[YOUR_ALBUM_ID]

Track: Fire In My Hands (2025)  
Embed URL: https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/[YOUR_TRACK_ID]
```

Once you have these, just paste them here and I'll update the site immediately!
